User Registration Password 7.x-1.x-dev 2013-01-18
---------------------------------------------

  Migrated functionality from user_registrationpass_extra:
- New: Password reset form flood control + privacy.
- New: Settings for flood control via flood_control module.
- New: Resend password confirmation mail from admin/users.
- New: Added support for the rpt module.

- Bug: Fixed wrong tokens in e-mail activation template
  http://drupal.org/node/1832002
- Bug: Fixed missing token on configuration page
  http://drupal.org/node/1831922
- Bug: Fixed Duplicate email using the verification email option (3rd option)
  By bago - https://drupal.org/node/1773430

- Task: Added tests. (admin config page test still needs work)
- Task: Codingstandards++ (almost done).
- Task: In-code documentation++ (still needs some work).

- CODE CHANGES: Changed logic a bit, be sure to review the
  changes if you develop on top of our module.
 * Added hook_user_presave() and set the 'account->login'
   to REQUEST_TIME on registration.
 * Added account->access and replaced account->login in the
   db queries with account->access. This makes the password
   reset just as secure and random as core again.

   These 2 changes enable us to use the core activation action
   next to ours and also makes sure blocking a new fresh user
   still works if the user has been created by an admin.

 * All static variables 'values' have changed.
 * Moved everything in user_registrationpassword_form_user_register_submit()
   function into the if() statement.
 * Created a new function: user_registrationpassword_set_message()
   to drupal_set_message() and redirect.
 * Did a lot of work to fix possible privacy issues.

   You need to run update.php.

TODO:
- Finish tests.
- Fix TODO markers.


User Registration Password 7.x-1.3 2012-09-12
---------------------------------------------
- Feature request: Translatable Confirmation E-Mail
  By kle - http://drupal.org/node/1321998
- New: The correct configuration options are set from the 1.3 release
  and higher during install. No need to configure anything from now on.
- New: The default 'Account activation' e-mail template will be
  overridden during installation, now it makes a lot more sense.
- Renamed the user_registrationpassword variable to
  'user_registrationpassword_registration'
  so we can actually remove it correctly via the uninstaller.
- Minor edit to the e-mail template.
- Small change in the logic, we used to check for the role of a user
  (if admin perms) before we called the submit handler, we now only check
  if the uid < 1. This fixes a minor possible issue. This module should
  only work if an anonymous user tries to register.
- Added an update function to update the variable names that changed.
- Added CHANGELOG.txt so people can check at all times what changed,
  even if d.o. is down. (for maintenance for example)
- Updated README.txt to reflect changes and remove wrong / unclear
  documentation.
